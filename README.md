This set of tools includes the following contentsï¼š

**Twelve Tone Matrix Calculator**	Computes the 12-Tone Matrix (or "Magic Square") based on a 12-tone row which you enter. Shows all possible Primes, Inversions, Retrogrades, and Retrograde Inversions of your row.

**Twelve Tone Row Analyzer**	Analyzes a twelve-tone row that you enter. Identifies the Pitch Class sets contained in the row and gives an idea of how the row will sound in music by virtue of the intervals it contains.

**Prime Form Calculator**	Compute the Prime Form, Forte Code, and Interval Vector of any pitch class set.

**Relationship Calculator**	Displays pitch class sets which are related (by a relationship that you choose) to a pitch class set that you select(includes the set subcomplex (Kh) relation) . For example: display all pitch class sets which are super-sets of the selected set.

**Common Relationship Calculator**	Displays pitch class sets which have a common relationship between two selected Pitch Class Sets.

Since this suite of tools requires ActiveX controls, and Windows 10/11 defaults to the Chromium - based Edge browser, it causes trouble for some enthusiasts. The fix is simple: right - click on the desktop to create a new shortcut and enter:

`"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" https://www.google.com/#ie={inputEncoding}&wd=%s -Embedding`

An IE browser icon will then appear on your desktop.

***I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Paul Nelson for his contributions and generosity.***
